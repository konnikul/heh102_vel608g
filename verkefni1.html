									<h1>Making a website<br />
									</h1>
									<p>In this project the goal was to make a website for the course. </p>
								</header>

								<p>  I started by watching videos made by the teacher on the project. Then I downloaded brackets and signed up to GitHub. </p>
                                    
                                <h3>How I made my website.</h3> 
                                
                                <p>I have no previous experience designing a website or working with HTML5. So I decided to use a template on the website 
                                <a href="https://html5up.net/"> HTML5 up </a>. I looked for a template for a while and decided to use the template<a href="https://html5up.net/massively"> Massivly. </a> </p>
                                <div class="image main"><img src="massivly.JPG" alt="" /></div>
                                <p>
                                It had features that I think would look good and be beneficial to what I am going to do with the website.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>After I downloaded the template and extracted the files into a working directory for this project I started editing the template. I changed the header and removed some features that I would not need, at least for now. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                I started by uploading my resume. I started working towards making a template for mmy resume in HTML see below
                                </p><div class="image main"><img src="hvernig_thu_bjost_til_template.PNG" alt="" /></div>
                                                            
                                <p>
                                As i was working towards puplishing my resume on the website I was using a resume I had already made using Latex, as a way to remeber everything. So I decided to publish that on the website instead of trying to make it look good in a language I had no experience with. I used <a href="https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/html/how-to-embed-pdf-in-html.html"> This video. </a> to figure out how I could upload the pdf document to the website. 
                                I made a reference page for the course and another page for the resume. The website is set up so that the projects are accessed through the reference page for the course. Then I set up a template page for future projects. And by doing that saved myself some work in the future. Below you can see the proccess of setting up a template page for future projects.</p>
                                    <div class="image main"><img src="template_verkefni.JPG" alt="" /></div>
                                <p>Then the final touches were made by uploading an image for the background. </p>
                                
                                <h3>Uploading my website to github</h3>
                                
                                <p>I started by installing <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win"> Git </a> on my computer. Then searched for a turtorial online by searching for "How to host a website on GitHub". I found this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hrJ4oN1u_8&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org"> video </a> wich explains the steps very well. </p>
                                <h3>The steps are as follows</h3>
								<ul>
                                <li>Make a new repository on GitHub</li>
								<li>Right click on the folder where your files are stored and select "Git Bash Here". This will open a Git command module.</li>
								<li>Type in the command "git init".</li>
								<li>Type in the command "git add ." and press enter.</li>
								<li>Type in the command "git commit -m "first commit"" and press enter</li>
                                <li>Type in the command "git remote ass originn url_to_your_repository" and press enter</li>
                                <li>Type in the command "git push -u origin main" and it will ask your GitHub username and password. Provide both and continue. </li>
								</ul>

                               <p>Now the code is uploaded to GitHub. I went to the settings for the repository I just created and found GitHub pages. Then I selected the main branch and choose the root folder. After saving these settings my website was published on GitHub.  </p>
